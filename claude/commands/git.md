## Git usage instructions
- Never include Claude Code banners in the commit messages.
- Include brief, to the point commit messages. Never yap for ever.
- Prefer commits in smaller chunks instead of one big commit. You can run multiple commits if you think it's smarter.
- Before commiting, make sure tests, linters and formatters pass.
- Feature branches should be named feature/<feature_name>
